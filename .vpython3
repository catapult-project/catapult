# This is a vpython "spec" file.
#
# It describes patterns for python wheel dependencies of the python scripts in
# the chromium repo, particularly for dependencies that have compiled components
# (since pure-python dependencies can be easily vendored into third_party).
#
# When vpython is invoked, it finds this file and builds a python VirtualEnv,
# containing all of the dependencies described in this file, fetching them from
# CIPD (the "Chrome Infrastructure Package Deployer" service). Unlike `pip`,
# this never requires the end-user machine to have a working python extension
# compilation environment. All of these packages are built using:
#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/master/infra/tools/dockerbuild/
#
# All python scripts in the repo share this same spec, to avoid dependency
# fragmentation.
#
# If you have depot_tools installed in your $PATH, you can invoke python scripts
# in this repo by running them as you normally would run them, except
# substituting `vpython` instead of `python` on the command line, e.g.:
#   vpython path/to/script.py some --arguments
#
# Read more about `vpython` and how to modify this file here:
#   https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/master/doc/users/vpython.md

   * A snapshot of an object instance, at a given moment in time.
   *
   * Initialization of snapshots and instances is three phased:
   *
   * 1. Instances and snapshots are constructed. This happens during event
   *    importing. Little should be done here, because the object's data
   *    are still being used by the importer to reconstruct object references.
   *
   * 2. Instances and snapshtos are preinitialized. This happens after implicit
   *    objects have been found, but before any references have been found and
   *    switched to direct references. Thus, every snapshot stands on its own.
   *    This is a good time to do global field renaming and type conversion,
   *    e.g. recognizing domain-specific types and converting from C++ naming
   *    convention to JS.
   *
   * 3. Instances and snapshtos are initialized. At this point, {id_ref:
   *    '0x1000'} fields have been converted to snapshot references. This is a
   *    good time to generic initialization steps and argument verification.
   *

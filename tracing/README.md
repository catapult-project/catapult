![Trace Viewer Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catapult-project/catapult/master/tracing/images/trace-viewer-circle-blue.png)

Trace-Viewer is the javascript frontend for Chrome [about:tracing](http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool) and [Android
systrace](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/systrace.html).

It provides rich analysis and visualization capabilities for many types of trace
files. Its particularly good at viewing linux kernel traces (aka [ftrace](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/trace/ftrace.txt)) and Chrome's
[trace_event format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview). Trace viewer can be [embedded](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/wiki/Embedding-Trace-Viewer) as a component in your own code, or used from a plain checkout to turn trace files into standalone, emailable HTML files from the commandline:

```
$CATAPULT/tracing/bin/trace2html my_trace.json --output=my_trace.html && open my_trace.html
```

Its easy to [extend trace viewer](https://github.com/catapult-project/catapult/blob/master/tracing/docs/extending-and-customizing-trace-viewer.md) to support your favorite trace format, or add domain specific visualizations to the UI to simplify drilling down into complex data.

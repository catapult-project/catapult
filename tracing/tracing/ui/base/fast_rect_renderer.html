/**
 * @fileoverview Provides a mechanism for drawing massive numbers of
 * colored rectangles into a canvas in an efficient manner, provided
 * they are drawn left to right with fixed y and height throughout.
 *
 * The basic idea used here is to fuse subpixel rectangles together so that
 * we never issue a canvas fillRect for them. It turns out Javascript can
 * do this quite efficiently, compared to asking Canvas2D to do the same.
 *
 * A few extra things are done by this class in the name of speed:
 * - Viewport culling: off-viewport rectangles are discarded.
 *
 * - The actual discarding operation is done in world space,
 *   e.g. pre-transform.
 *
 * - Rather than expending compute cycles trying to figure out an average
 *   color for fused rectangles from css strings, you instead draw using
 *   palletized colors. The fused rect color is choosen from the rectangle with
 *   the higher alpha value, if equal the max pallete index encountered.
 *
 * Make sure to flush the trackRenderer before finishing drawing in order
 * to commit any queued drawing operations.

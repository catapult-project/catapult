    * Earth Mover's distance (EMD), also known as the Wasserstein distance,
    * is used to compare distributions.
    * The Earth Mover's Distance between two distributions is proportional
    * to the minimum amount of work required to change one distribution into
    * the other.
    * One unit of work in this case is equal to the amount of work necessary
    * to move one unit of 'dirt' by one unit of distance.
    * For one-dimensional distributions, when the two distributions are
    * non-negative and are of the same size (contain same amount of dirt),
    * there exists a closed form formula for the EMD between these two
    * distributions. The EMD in that case is equal to the area between the
    * CDFs of the two distributions.

    * This function takes in two histograms as input, represented as an array
    * of numbers where the n-th element is the weight of the n-th bin.
    * It throws an error if the two input histograms don't have same number
    * of bins.
    *
    * @param {number[]} firstHistogram histogram of the first distribution.
    * @param {number[]} secondHistogram histogram of the second distribution.

"""Thresholds used for hypothesis testing.

The "low threshold" is the traditional significance threshold. If the p-value is
below the "low threshold", we say the two samples come from different
distributions (reject the null hypothesis).

We also define a "high threshold". If the p-value is above the "high threshold",
we say the two samples come from the same distribution (reject the alternative
hypothesis).

If the p-value is in between the two thresholds, we fail to reject either
hypothesis. This means we need more information to make a decision. As the
sample sizes increase, the high threshold decreases until it crosses the
low threshold. This way, there's a limit on the number of repeats.

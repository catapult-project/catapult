"""Change Exploration Module

In this module we expose the Speculate function which generates a list of
potential Change instances for exploration in the effort to find candidate
Changes to identify culprits. We use a binary search within a range of changes
to identify potential culprits and expose the list of changes in between
revisions in a commit range.

If we think about the range of changes as a list of revisions, each represented
as a subscripted 'c' in the list below:

  [c[0], c[1], c[2], ..., c[N]]

We can treat a binary search through the range c[0]..c[N] to be a binary tree of
subscripts in the range 0..N as shown below:

                 N1/2
       N1/4                N3/4
  N1/8      N3/8      N5/8      N7/8
                 ....


This is useful when attempting to bisect a potentially large range of revisions
quickly when finding one or more culprit changes for performance regressions.
Being able to speculate levels ahead of the bisection range gives us a means for
trading machine resources to reduce overall time-to-culprits when bisecting
large revision ranges.

  This function yields a list of tuples with the following form:

    (insertion index, change)

  Where `insertion index` refers to an index in the `changes` argument. The
  returned list is in insertion order with the property that if applied in the
  given order to the `changes` list that the resulting `changes` list is in a
  valid relative ordering of revisions to explore.

  Arguments:
  - changes: a list of Change instances.
  - change_detected: a predicate returning True whether we can detect a change
    between two Change instances, None if the result is inconclusive.
  - on_unknown: a callable invoked when change_detected returns None
    (or is inconclusive) taking both changes.
  - midpoint: a callable invoked returning the midpoint between two changes,
    returning an object of the same type as the arguments or None;
    midpoint(a, b) -> m|None where type(m) == type(a) && type(m) == type(b).
  - levels: the depth of the binary search to explore for speculation; default
    is 2.

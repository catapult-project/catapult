<b>📍 Missing Values</b>

Pinpoint detected only transitions from "no values" to "some values" measured
while bisecting. This could be because the benchmark in the range:

- Did not produce any values given the parameters provided to Pinpoint.

- Failed to build at a revision due to underlying infrastructure failures.

Here's a list of {{missing_values[:5]|length}}:

{% for diff in missing_values[:5] -%}
<b>{{ diff.commit_info['subject'] }}</b> by {{ diff.commit_info['author'] }}
{{ diff.commit_info['url'] }}
{% if metric %}{{ metric }}: {% endif -%}
{{ diff.Formatted() }}
{%- if not loop.last %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor -%}

You can try the following when retrying the bisection:

- If it's due to broken builds, consider providing a patch (a Gerrit change)
  to un-break the build for the range.

- You can reduce the range to a smaller range.

# This file specifies dependencies required to bootstrap Telemetry. It is in a
# minimal version of the format used by other DEPS files that gclient can read,
# but it should only be used to bootstrap Telemetry *outside* of a normal
# Chrome checkout. In particular, the normal 'value' part of the python
# dict is not used and hence does not contain real URLs for the repos.

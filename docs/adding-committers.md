# Adding contributors

Admins (nduca, sullivan) can add contributors to the project. There are three
steps:

1.  Check that the person has signed the Contributor License Agreement.
    You can check [here](http://go/check-cla). If they have not signed, please
    redirect them to [this page]
    (https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual?csw=1) and wait
    for them to sign before adding.
2.  Add the person's github account to the [catapult]
    (https://github.com/orgs/catapult-project/teams/catapult) team.
3.  Add the person's email to the [commit queue list]
(https://chrome-infra-auth.appspot.com/auth/groups#project-catapult-committers).

Because there is no API to retrieve a person's GitHub ID from their email
address or vice versa, we cannot automate this into one step.
